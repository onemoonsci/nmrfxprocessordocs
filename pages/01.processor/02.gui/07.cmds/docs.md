### Scripting the GUI with Python

Tools for controlling the display of spectra from Python scripts are under
development.  The following is a summary of currently available commands.
These are all assocciated with the **nw** command.  So, for example, to
expand the currently active window to the region contained within the
crosshairs you would execute *nw.expand()*.

The commands mostly operate
on a single spectrum area (bounded by axes) which we refer to below
as a **chart**.  Many commands operate on the currently active chart.  By default,
this is the last chart created or the last one
that the mouse was clicked in.

### active

Get or set the active chart. 

When getting the active chart the command will return a name.
When setting the active chart the argument can be a name of a chart, in which case it is specified as a string (i.e. in quotes),
or it can be a number, in which case it is an index into the number of charts in the current stage (counting from 0).

By default, and somewhat confusingly, the name of a chart is actually a string representation of an index of the total number of charts created.
So the first chart ever created is named "1", the second "2", etc.



Examples:

       aChart = nw.active()
       nw.active('4')  # Set the active chart to be the one named '4'
                       # (the fourth chart ever created in this session)
       nw.active(3)    # Set the active chart to be the one with index
                       # (counting from 0) 3, within this stage.

One could loop over all the charts in a stage with something like:

    for iChart in range(nw.nCharts()):
        nw.active(iChart)
        nw.config(lvl=0.5)



### axlim

Set plot limit for a specified axis

Examples:

       nw.axlim('x',6.0,9.0)


### center

Centers chart on a specified position.  If no arguments are given the position is that of the crosshairs.
 
Examples:

    nw.center()             # center on crosshair position
    nw.center(8.55)         # center on an x value of 8.55
    nw.center(8.55,174)     # center on an x value of 8.55 and y value of 174.0
    nw.center(x=8.60)       # center on an x value of 8.60
    nw.center(x=8.60,y=175) # center on an x value of 8.60 and y value of 175.0

### colors

Currently applies to pseudo 2D datasets (an array of 1D datasets).  Allows user to specify a color used for specified rows.

Examples:

        nw.colors([3,4],'blue')   Set rows 3 and 4 (starting at 0) to be colored blue

### config

Configure parameters of active chart.  With no arguments returns a dictionary of parameters currently set on chart.

Examples:
    
     nw.config()
        neg: true, negWidth: 0.5, lvl: 1.8488425889503632, clm: 1.2, pos: true, posColor: #000000FF, negColor: #FF0000FF, posWidth: 0.5, nlvls: 20}

     nw.config(lvl=2.0)

### datasets

Get or set the list of datasets in the active chart.  A given chart can have multiple datasets so the datasets are set and returned as python lists.

Examples:

    datasets = nw.datasets()

    nw.datasets(['hnco.nv'])

### draw

Redraw active chart

Examples:

    nw.draw()

### drawAll

Redraw all charts in active stage

Examples:

    nw.drawAll()



### expand

Expand chart to region in crosshairs

Examples:

    nw.expand()

### full

Show full spectrum in chart.  A dimension name can be specified so the full range is only done for that dimension.

Examples:

    nw.full()

    nw.full('y')


### geometry

Return or set the geometry (x, y, width, height) for the active stage.

Examples:

    geom = nw.geometry()

    nw.geometry(x=500,y=600, width = 400, height=500)

    nw.geometry(x=300,y=400)
   

### getCursor

Return the cursor used in the active chart (CROSSHAIR or MOVE)

Examples:

    nw.getCursor()

### getDAttrs

Gets a list of the DatasetAttributes in the active chart.  This is a low-level, command for advanced use.


### getDims

Get list of dataset dimensions (indices starting at 0) that are currently displayed on chart

Examples:

        dims = nw.getDims('hnco.nv')

### getGrid()

Get the current grid in the active stage
   
Examples:

      grid = nw.getGrid()

### grid

Create a grid of charts in current stage.  With no arguments resets the grid to a single chart.

Examples:

    nw.grid(rows=3,columns=2)

### lim
    Get or set the plot limits of current chart.

Examples:

       nw.lim()
           {x: [6.441539693970839, 9.495060306029162], y: [167.06294474318503, 182.93926565771682], z: [64.0, 64.0]}

       nw.lim(x=[4.0,7.0])

### nCharts

Return the number of charts in current stage.

Examples:

      n = nw.nCharts()


### new

Create new stage (toplevel window)

Examples:

    nw.new()

### offsets

Currently applies to pseudo 2D datasets (an array of 1D datasets).  Allows user to specify a vertical offset used for specified rows.

Examples:

        nw.offset([3,4],0.2)   Set rows 3 and 4 (starting at 0) to have an offset of 0.2 (as a fraction from 0 to 1.0)

### pconfig

Configure peak parameters of active chart.  With no arguments returns a dictionary of parameters currently set on chart.

Examples:

        nw.pconfig()
             simPeaks: false, displayType: Peak, offColor: 0xff0000ff, drawPeaks: true, labelType: Number, onColor: 0x000000ff}

        nw.pconfig(onColor='0xff0000')

### peakLists

Get or set the list of peaklists in the active chart.  A given chart can have multiple peaklists so the peaklists are set and returned as python lists.

Examples:

    peakLists = nw.peakLists()

    nw.peakLists(['hnco'])


### rows

Currently applies to pseudo 2D datasets (an array of 1D datasets).  Allows user to specify .which rows are displayed
   
        nw.rows([3,4])   Display rows 3 and 4.  All other rows are invisible.

### setDims

Set dataset dimensions (indices starting at 0) that should be displayed on chart)

Examples:

        nw.setDims('hnco.nv',[0,2,1])

### showPeak
    Jump chart display region to center on specified peak

Examples:

        nw.showPeak('hnco.32')
### stages

Should return a list of activew stages, but currently broken

### useActive

Set the active controller for the scripting commands to that of the active chart.  Advanced useage.

### zoom

Zoom in window according to specified factor

Examples:

       nw.zoom(1.1)
       nw.zoom(factor= 0.9)
