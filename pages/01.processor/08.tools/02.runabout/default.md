### RunAbout : A tool for assigning protein spectra

RunAbout is a tool for semi-automated assignment of protein NMR spectra.
Not only does it arrange regions from related spectra to facilitate
comparisons of peak positions, it also uses the patterns one expects to
detect between sequential peaks in related spectra to make best-guesses
at sequential assignments. Thus, the spectroscopist can leave much of
the assignment task to the automated portions of Runabout, and spend
more time resolving the trickier assignment questions using a
combination of knowledge and software guidance. RunAbout is
distinguished from fully automated assignment routines by its users'
ability to choose between 1) trusting the software's assignments, 2)
reviewing every suggested assignment and approving or disapproving it,
and 3) manually assigning the peaks in an environment with easy and
robust bookkeeping.
