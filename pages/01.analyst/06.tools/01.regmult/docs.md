These are tools that can be utilized for analyzing one-dimensional spectra. The regions
tool is used for sub-dividing the spectrum into regions which can be integrated
and deconvoluted into overlapping peak shapes.  The multiplet tool allows you to
analyze the spectra to find peaks and group them into multiplets (singlets, doublets
etc.)
